# CASA0010 Dissertation Repository
This repository is created by Ximeng Chang from the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), UCL, for the CASA0010 dissertation project.

It contains three main folders: 
## data:
This folder includes all raw and processed datasets used in the dissertation.  
All data were obtained from publicly available sources and have been approved under UCL’s ethical guidelines. 
## python:
This folder contains two Python scripts that document the full data processing and analysis workflow.  
Some figures generated here were used solely for internal data checking and are not included in the final dissertation.  
*Note: The data used contain Chinese fields. Therefore, some variable names and data content may appear in Chinese. English annotations (#) are provided alongside to aid understanding.* 
## figures:
This folder stores all the output figures generated by the Python scripts.  
Due to the lack of Chinese font support in JupyterLab, some figures may not display Chinese text correctly.  
Final versions of these visuals were refined in PowerPoint and embedded in the Word version of the dissertation.
